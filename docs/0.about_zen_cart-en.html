<h1 class="intro">What Is Zen Cart&trade;? </h1>
</center>
<div>
<h1>What &amp; History</h1>
<h3>Designed for Online Merchants</h3>
Zen Cart&trade; <EM>truly is</EM> the art of e-commerce; a free, user-friendly, open source shopping cart system. The software is being developed by group of like-minded shop owners, programmers, designers, and consultants that think e-commerce could be and should be done differently. Some "solutions" seem to be complicated programming exercises instead of responding to users' needs, Zen Cart&trade; puts the merchant's and shopper's requirements first. Similarly, other programs are nearly impossible to install and use without an IT degree, Zen Cart&trade; can be installed and set-up by anyone with the most basic computer skills. Others are so expensive ... not Zen Cart&trade;, it's FREE! 
<br />
<H3>Designed for Online Shoppers</H3>
Zen Cart&trade; will deliver the ultimate online shopping experience to your customers. Navigating through your merchandise offerings is a breeze with Zen Cart&trade;, the program provides several "Spotlight" lists in addition to the traditional category to product links. Once a product is added to the shopping cart, secure checkout is a simple 3-step process. After providing the billing information, your customer chooses the shipping method. (multiple shipping methods including real-time internet shipping quotes are built-in) Next, a payment type is chosen from one of the popular payment modules. (PayPal&trade; and AuthorizeNet&trade; are just 2 of the included modules) Last, the customer reviews the order, shipping and payment choices, and confirms the order. You are immediately notified of the order and your customer automatically receives an e-mail confirmation.
Zen Cart&trade; addresses many of the goals we set:
<UL>
<LI>make the program easy to set up
<LI>make it easy to customize
<LI>automate tasks, such as order confirmation 
<LI>make navigation simple 
<LI>built in promotions; discount coupons, gift certificates, newsletters and product notification 
<LI>offer single item specials and storewide discounts, including group discounts and quantity discounts
<LI>built in Search Engine Optimization tools, including per-product metatag controls 
<LI>password protect the Administration Tool
<LI>support multiple languages, currencies and tax structures </LI>
</UL>
In short, Zen Cart&trade; is shopping cart software the way it should have been all along.
<br />
