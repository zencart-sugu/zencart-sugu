Welcome to Zen Cart(tm) E-Commerce
Version 1.3.0.2-l10n-jp-5

THE FOLLOWING IS A VERY SIMPLIFIED INSTALLATION DOCUMENT.
WE SUGGEST YOU USE THE HTML VERSIONS IN THE /docs FOLDER FOR MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS.

ALL OF OUR README DOCUMENTS ARE IN THE /docs FOLDER OF THIS DISTRIBUTION.


Zen Cart has a built-in automatic installation system. However to use this you must first unpack
the code to a web server.

The web server can either be on your local computer or on an internet host.

To start off, you should have to extract the Zen Cart(tm) ZIP file. How you do this depends on the operating system you use.

Once extracted, you will have a directory containing the Zen Cart(tm) scripts.

The contents of this directory needs to be moved to your webserver, either by copying the directory or
by using an FTP progam.

You will then need to run the install script.

To do this you need to open a browser and type in the URL.

If you are running on a your own computer, this will be

   http://localhost/{zen-cart-directory}/zc_install/

or if on a live server:

   http://{www.mydomain.com}/zc_install/

You then only need to follow the prompts to install Zen Cart(tm).

For more detailed installation instructions, please see the /docs/1.readme_installation.html document in this distribution.
